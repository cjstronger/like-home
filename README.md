React project made with React-query, react-hook, supabase for the backend and some small libraries like toast to help the ui.
May 12 - added more mutation to the project to edit the fields within cabins, just as annoying as I thought it would be tbh. But I've got the hang now. Seems easier as you go. Also added a modal for the cabins creation page, learning about compound components now, making it easier enabling very flexible components.
